##pi/bearsay

I love bears beary beary much. And I hate seeing "cowsay" as the only name appearing on the opensource ascii art market. Therefore I decided to make my own shell script resembling its functions.

##Usage

<code>./bearsay {normally | upsidedown} {--custom-files /path/to/file.ascii} "something i want to say"</code>

##Better hacks

Simply change randombear.ascii or add any ascii files if you want. The ASCII files shall be specified by<br>
<code>./bearsay normally --custom-files /path/to/file.ascii ""</code>
